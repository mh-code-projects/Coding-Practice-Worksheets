# Coding Practice Worksheets

Hands-on drills & practice sheets for JavaScript, SQL, and browser-based exercises. The purpose of these worksheets is to build understanding and repeition on fundamentals. 

Each worksheet starts with the concept basics, and progressively gets more challenging. The idea is to give experience into how each concept can be used and various ways they can be applied in real world scenarios. 

## Quick Start
- Open `index.html` with Live Server (or double-click) and choose which worksheet to load by editing the single `<script>` tag—point it at any file in `javascript/worksheets/` such as `js_forEach_practice_1_solutions.js`.
- Keep DevTools console open while you edit the worksheet file; saving will refresh and rerun the script in the browser.
- Worksheets also run standalone in Node: `node javascript/worksheets/js_basics_practice_1.js`.
- No build step required. Everything is plain HTML/CSS/JS and a few `.sql` files.

## Tips
- Tackle a worksheet and then compare with the paired solution file (e.g., `js_method_map_practice_1.js` and `js_method_map_practice_1_solutions.js`).
- Keep console open when using the browser pages to see logged results or errors.
